### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects:
- GS, General Store, is a Rust based file management and server with security features on files and folders.
- Integrations with Twitch
- Custom WSL2 instance using Arch and i3 with some other packages I use regularly.

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I am a polyglot programmer
- I run a modest homelab
- I am a fan of DC but the Marvel movies are better
- I enjoy and collect TV shows and Movies

I am a polyglot when it comes to software development. I bring a unique perspective and coding style based on my experience with multiple languages. I firmly believe there is no one size fits all language and they should be used as tools and no one language can cover every need.
