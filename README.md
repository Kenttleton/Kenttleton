### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

If you are coming from the Degree Free Podcast, Welcome! I haven't touched a lot of the older repositories on my account. It really shows my ability from the baginning and where I started. You will also notice that a lot of things are unfinished or broken. I use my github as a playground to try out techniques to work on learning things so a lot of it is unfinished because I learned what I wanted and moved on.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects:
- Mockchain, is a mock blockchain implementation to cover the basics of blockchain and how they could interact with teachother.
- GS, General Store, is a Rust based file management and server with security features on files and folders with techniques similar to WebDAV.

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I run a modest homelab
- I am a fan of the DC universe but the recent Marvel content has been awesome.
- I enjoy and collect TV shows and Movies

I am a polyglot when it comes to software development. I bring a unique perspective and coding style based on my experience across multiple languages and frameworks. I firmly believe there is no one size fits all solution and languages should be used as tools not standards.
