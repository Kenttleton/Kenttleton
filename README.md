### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects:
- GS, General Store, is a Rust based file management and server with security features on files and folders with techniques similar to WebDAV.
- Integrations with Twitch to help with streaming.
- Custom WSL2 instance using Arch and i3 with some other packages I use regularly.

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I run a modest homelab
- I am a fan of the DC universe but the Marvel movies (and now streaming series) are better
- I enjoy and collect TV shows and Movies

I am a polyglot when it comes to software development. I bring a unique perspective and coding style based on my experience across multiple languages and frameworks. I firmly believe there is no one size fits all solution and languages should be used as tools not standards.
